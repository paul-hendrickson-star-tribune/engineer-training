# Callback functions

Callback functions are functions that are passed in as an argument to another function (or method) that are then called at some point during the process of the function that it was passed into. Callback functions execute in the scope of the function that it was passed into and and therefore can be passed arguments from the calling function, and can also take arguments from the scope they were passed from.
